Command Scheduler:
Runs commands ever 20 ms
Contains a scheduler that registers the buttons pressed/commands needing to be ran, and runs them accordingly
Once a command is run, the scheduler ends the command
Runs periodic() method in each Subsystem

Subsystems:
Abstraction for a collection of robot hardware that operates as one
Most methods private so methods can be replicated safely in other Subsystems
CommandScheduler never schedules a command that comes from the same subsystem--either interrupts current command or is ignored
Default commands-automatically scheduled when no other command is running
Take care of basic functionality

Creating Subsystems:
extends SubsystemBase, holds common methods that are useful for each subsystem
one variable for each piece for hardware
motors and sensors defined at top--private and final
initialize hardware in constructor
if you need to access values, use getters & setters

Periodic method:
Called every 20 ms
usually logs/getters for values
updates basic values/basic tasks
dont control motors

Requirements and default commands:
Only one method per subsystem at any given time
periodic always runs, so if method that moves motors is ran and the robot is in a bad circumstance, it is bad
since motor commmands cant be called in periodic, they are called in "Default Command"
default command--gaurantees behavior if input
