// Instructions:
// 1. create a branch off of this branch and title it firstname-lastname-week-4
// 2. you are responsible for instantiating the two motors for this subsystem
// 3. you are responsible for applying stator and supply current limits
//    for each of the motors (recommended 65 Amp stator current limits & 30 Amp limit for supply)
// 4. use the appropriate control mode for running the Tank Drive (and leave a comment for why you are using it)
// Hint: besides defining the motors in the constructor, the main method that your Tank Drive
// needs takes in input to drive the left and right motors each with a control request
