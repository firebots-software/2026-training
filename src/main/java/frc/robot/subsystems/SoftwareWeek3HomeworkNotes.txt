A subsystem a group of code for a multiple pieces of hardware that work together
It is important to restrict access to a subsystem to prevent problems
It is easy to use subsystems using CommandSchedular
Subsystems are for controlling basic functions. Commands put this together to do more complicated things
All subsystems have a lot of basic things in common so its good to put them all in a parent class
Whenever doing an action on a piece of hardware, always do it through the subsystem that contains it

Periodic() method is what the code runs periodically every cycle. This is for housekeeping tasks. The method is optional.
Never control motors from the periodic method.

Subsystems only do one thing at a time.
